A scikit-learn compatible hyperbox-base machine learning library in Python.

Introduction
------------
**hyperbox-brain** is a Python open source toolbox implementing hyperbox-based machine learning algorithms built on top of
scikit-learn and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2018 by Prof. `Bogdan Gabrys <https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Bogdan.Gabrys>`_ and Dr. `Thanh Tung Khuat <https://thanhtung09t2.wixsite.com/home>`_ at the Complex Adaptive Systems Lab - The
University of Technology Sydney. This project is a core module aiming to the formulation of explainable life-long learning 
systems in near future.
